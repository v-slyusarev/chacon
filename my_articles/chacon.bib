 abstract = {Let K denote the group of all automorphisms of a finite Lebesgue space equipped with the weak topology. For T ∈ K, let σT denote its maximal spectral type. Theorem 1. There is a dense Gδ subset $G \subset K$ such that, for each T ∈ G and k(1),..., k(l) ∈ Z+, K'(1), ..., k'(l' ∈ Z+, the convolutions σTk(1) *...* σTk(1) *...* σTk'(l') are mutually singular, provided that $(k(1), \dots,k(l))$ is not a rearrangement of (k'(1),...,k'(l')). Theorem 1 has the following consequence. Theorem 2. k has a dense Gδ subset $F \subset G$ such that for T ∈ F the follwing holds: For any k: N → Z - 0 and l ∈ Z -0, the only way that Tl, or any factor thereof, can sit as a factor in Tk(1) × Tk(2) × ⋯ is inside the ith coordinate σ-algebra for some i with k(i) = l. Theorem 2 has applications to the construction of certaqin counterexamples, in particular nondisjoint automorphisms having no common factors and weakly isomorphic authomorphisms that are not isomorphic.},
